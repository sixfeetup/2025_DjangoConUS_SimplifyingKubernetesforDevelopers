Here’s a **draft lightning talk deck in Markdown** for Reveal.js, designed to engage a skeptical audience who feels Kubernetes is “too complicated.” I’ve kept it tight, fast-paced, and focused on **the pain → Tilt as relief → quick demo/mental model → takeaway.**

You can drop this into a Reveal.js setup (`slides.md`) and present directly.

# Tilt: Simplifying Kubernetes for Developers
### [Your Name] · [Conference]

---

## The Problem: Kubernetes Complexity

- Kubernetes is powerful… but
- **Too many YAML files**
- **Slow feedback loops**
- **Developers feel disconnected**
- Devs just want to **write code & see it run**

---

## The Gap

- Docker gave us: *build → run → test → iterate fast*
- Kubernetes feels like: *build → push → wait → apply → debug → repeat*
- Local dev workflow is broken

---

## Enter Tilt 🚀

- Open source dev tool: [tilt.dev](https://tilt.dev)
- Automates your **inner dev loop** on Kubernetes
- Gives you a **dashboard** to see what's running
- Feels like `npm start` or `flask run`… but for K8s

---

## How It Works (High-Level)

1. Define resources in a `Tiltfile` (like a dev recipe)
2. Run `tilt up`
3. Tilt watches your code & rebuilds containers live
4. Instant feedback in the Tilt UI

---

## Example: Tiltfile

```python
docker_build('my-app', '.')
k8s_yaml('k8s/deployment.yaml')
k8s_resource('my-app')
````

👉 That’s enough to:

* Build your container
* Deploy to Kubernetes
* Reload on code changes

---

## Why Developers Love Tilt

* **Faster iterations** (seconds, not minutes)
* **Less YAML** in daily workflow
* **Clear UI** for pods, logs, status
* Works with your existing Kubernetes setup

---

## Tilt in Action

* Start Tilt: `tilt up`
* Edit your code → live update in cluster
* Watch app refresh instantly
* No more "rebuild, push, redeploy, wait"

---

## Key Takeaway

> Kubernetes isn’t too complicated.
> It’s just missing a developer experience layer.

**Tilt = `npm start` for Kubernetes.**

### Speaker Notes (for you)
- **Intro**: Acknowledge the elephant in the room—yes, Kubernetes *is* complex. Laugh with the audience.  
- **The Problem**: Emphasize the broken dev loop—slow, clunky, frustrating.  
- **Tilt**: Position as a *developer-first* tool, not another layer of ops jargon.  
- **Demo Slide**: If possible, actually run `tilt up` on a small sample app. Even showing the UI screenshot helps.  
- **Key Takeaway**: Reframe Kubernetes—problem isn’t complexity, it’s missing tooling. Tilt provides the missing workflow.

Would you like me to also **design background images/icons (lightning bolts, “npm start for K8s” slogan, Tilt UI screenshots)** so you have visuals for the deck, or keep it plain Markdown/text-based for now?
